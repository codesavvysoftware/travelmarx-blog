This code was the original code for the blog post [C++ Console Application to Get Comments from a Microsoft Word File](http://blog.travelmarx.com/2011/03/c-console-application-to-get-comments.html).

You can see a Visual Studio C++ project with this code and all the pieces to make it compile and run in the project [ExtractComments](https://github.com/travelmarx/travelmarx-blog/tree/master/ExtractComments) project.
